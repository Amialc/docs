**Note:** In order to install or customize plugins, you will need to use a self-hosted WordPress.org site. Using the WordPress.com site does not allow installing plugins.

There are two ways to install the Login by Auth0 WordPress plugin:

- Installing via the [WordPress Store](#installing-via-the-wordpress-store)
- Uploading the [`wp-auth0` folder](#manually-uploading-the-plugin-file) to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory

## Installing via the WordPress Store

While logged in as an administrator of your WordPress installation, go to the **Plugins** menu item.

Search for the **Login By Auth0** plugin, and click **Install Now**.

Once the installation completes, click **Activate Plugin**.

At this point, your installation is complete, and you can now [configure the plugin](/cms/wordpress/configuration).

## Manually Uploading the Plugin File

Download the plugin zip file from the [WordPress Plugins site](https://wordpress.org/plugins/auth0/).

While logged in as an administrator of your WordPress installation, go to the **Plugins** menu item.
