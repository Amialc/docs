## 1. Setting up the Callback URL

<div class="setup-callback">
<p>Go to the <a href="${manage_url}/#/applications/${account.clientId}/settings">Application Settings</a> section in your Auth0 dashboard and make sure that the <b>Allowed Callback URLs</b> field contains the following values:</p>

```
https://${account.namespace}/mobile, file:///
```

## 2. Add the Lock Widget

Add **Auth0Lock** to your `index.html` file and set the viewport.

> **Note:** Some functionality provided by Lock is meant for regular web browsers. For best results, add `auth: { sso: false }` to your Lock configuration options.

## 4. Follow the Front End Quickstarts

You can use any front end technology you like in your Electron application. Follow the [quickstart](/quickstart/spa) guide specific to your use case.
