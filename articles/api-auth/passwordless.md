# OIDC-conformant Passwordless Authentication

<%= include('./tutorials/adoption/_about.md') %>

Auth0 currently does not support an [OIDC-conformant](/api-auth/tutorials/adoption) passwordless authentication mechanism.
OIDC-conformant clients will not be able to use the new authentication pipeline or request API access tokens.

We plan on implementing OIDC-conformant passwordless authentication in future releases.
